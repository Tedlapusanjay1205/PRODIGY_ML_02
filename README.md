🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation using Hierarchical Clustering
This repository contains a Data Science project that leverages Hierarchical Clustering to segment customers of a mall into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. These customer segments can help businesses understand their audience and develop targeted marketing strategies.

✨ Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into customer demographics and spending habits.
Clustering Analysis: Apply Hierarchical Clustering to group customers with similar characteristics.
Visualization: Use dendrograms and 2D/3D plots to visualize customer segments.
Business Insights: Provide actionable insights for marketing and customer engagement.
🚀 Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Scipy
Tools: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Workflow
Data Understanding:

Explore and understand the customer dataset features.
Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize numerical data to improve clustering accuracy.
Hierarchical Clustering:

Compute distances and construct dendrograms to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Assign customers to clusters.
Visualization:

Plot dendrograms to show the clustering process.
Visualize clusters in 2D/3D space based on key features.
Insights & Recommendations:

Provide actionable insights based on the clusters identified.
📈 Results
Successfully segmented customers into X groups.
Identified key characteristics of each segment, such as:
High spenders: Customers with high income and high spending score.
Budget-conscious: Customers with low income but high spending score.
And more...
📚 Dataset
Source: Specify the dataset source (e.g., Kaggle, public datasets).
Description: Briefly describe the dataset, including features like Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
